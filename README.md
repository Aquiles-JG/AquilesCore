<h2>My collection of Rimworld mods</h2>
<p>Modding is my hobby. I am a middle-aged man that enjoys modding games more than actually playing them. A hopeless D&D nostalgic. I have been working on these projects for many years now. Hopefully for many more. I only use GitHub for safekeeping and backup purposes. All mods here, including this one, are for private use only.</p>

Thank you to all Rimworld modders out there, that through the years served me as inspiration and example to fuel countless hours of time spent in this passion.
<h3>Special thanks</h3>
I take my hat off to IcyCheeseCake for the amazing art, Taranchuk for the priceless code and Oskar Potocki for the opportunity to work with a professional modder.

# AquilesCore
<p>A library for the shared DLLs. A necessary dependency for every mod of my modpack. Nothing too fancy or groundbreaking, and all performance friendly.</p>
